## My Matrix Library

My library performs operations on matrices.
The library contains several constructors.

The main methods of the library:

1) Addition and subtraction of matrices;
2) Multiplication matrix by a number;
3) Matrix multiplication;
4) Raising the matrix to a power;
5) The method of calculating the determinant of a matrix by the basic definition (with permutations);
6) Calculation of the matrix of minors for the elements matrix_ij of the matrix;
7) Computation of the inverse matrix;
8) Transpose matrix;
9) Calculating the rank of the matrix;
10) Sum of elements of the main diagonal of the matrix;
